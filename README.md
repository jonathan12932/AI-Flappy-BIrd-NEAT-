# AI-Flappy-BIrd-NEAT

This project implements an AI agent to play Flappy Bird using the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm. The AI learns to play the game by evolving its neural network over multiple generations.

Features
Custom Flappy Bird Implementation: Built from scratch using PyGame for rendering and game mechanics.
AI Agent: Utilizes the NEAT algorithm to evolve neural networks capable of controlling the bird.
Real-time Visualization: Watch the AI learn and improve as it navigates the pipes.
Customizable Parameters: Adjust NEAT settings (e.g., mutation rates, population size) for experimentation.
